					<p><b>Help food colleagues better manage gaps on shelves</b></p>
					<p>How annoying is it, when you pop to Co-op for your lunch, and they have run out of your favourite sandwich or salad.  If only you have been there 30 minutes sooner.  Or even 30 minutes later once a store colleague has had time to put out extra stock.  “Oopse, sorry, sorry.”  I’m now in the way, blocking up the aisle trying to decide what to get instead. Boy it is busy in here at lunchtimes…</p>
                    <p>At Co-op we have an established daily process called Gap Scan to inform supply chain about stock issues.  But this doesn’t necessarily reflect what the customer experiences on shelf on a minute-by-minute basis.  This forms the basis of the challenge: To use sales data to estimate, at as fine a time interval as possible, when something might have gone awry with a customer’s ability to buy a product.</p><br>

        <div class="about-div" id="challenge2" style="visibility: hidden;font-size:12px;">
					<p><b>Improve funeralcare's allocation of people and ceremonial vehicles to funerals</b></p>
					<p>We'll have data that shows historical funerals, when and where they were and what resources they consumed. we'll also have data on resources including where theyre based and how they get used.
example outputs - inform the business on why there are inconsistencies across the country, how to improve resource use, visualise the data in a way that tells a useful story, create an app that helps ops colleague make resource decisions.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="about-div" id="challenge3" style="visibility: hidden;font-size:12px;">
					<p><b>1AS room booking data revamp</b></p>
					<p>We'll have anonymised room bookings, meeting titles, when and where.
example outputs - how could we better use our space in 1AS, what patterns are causing people to find there's no space, make a new room booking software that's better for users than the current one.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="about-div" id="faq" style="visibility: hidden;font-size:12px;">
            <p><b>Do I have to be available for both days?</b></p>
					<p>No you can drop in an out or just spend the time you can helping the teams.</p>
            <p><b>Is this commercially safe?</b></p>
					<p>Yes, there has been enough meetings to ensure that these challenges are commercially safe.</p>
            <p><b>Will it be competitive?</b></p>
					<p>No, although there may be some prizes for taking part!</p>
            <p><b>I'm not very "technical", will I be of any use?</b></p>
					<p>Yes! We need people of all skills and abilities from across the business units.</p>

        <div class="about-div" id="about" style="visibility: visible;font-size:12px;">
            <p>The Co-op Hackathon 2018, we are bringing together Data Analysts, BI Analysts, Data Engineers, Web
                Devlopers and many others from around the whole of the Co-op to demystify some of our data sink holes.
                To do this we have set out three difficult but fun challenges from accross the Co-op's business units.
                We have one from retail, one from funeral care and one from estates. All of these challenges have been
                planned over the last few months so that both days flow smoothly and we will have domain experts
                available to answer any inevitable questions.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that all of the data used on the day has been authorised for use, the environments
            used for storing data will be safe but will still give the teams free reign to solve the tasks in inventive
                ways, because that is what you are all good at!</p>
